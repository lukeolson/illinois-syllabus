### Integrity

### Grievance

### Support resources and supporting fellow students in distress [1]

As members of the Illinois community, we each have a responsibility to express
care and concern for one another.  If you come across a classmate whose
behavior concerns you, whether in regards to their well-being or yours, we
encourage you to refer this behavior to the Student Assistance Center
(333-0050) or online at odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/referral/. Based
upon your report, staff in the Student Assistance Center reaches out to
students to make sure they have the support they need to be healthy and safe.
Further, we understand the impact that struggles with mental health can have on
your experience at Illinois; significant stress, strained relationships,
anxiety, excessive worry, alcohol/drug problems, a loss of motivation, or
problems with eating and/or sleeping can all interfere with optimal academic
performance. We encourage all students to reach out to talk with someone, and
want to make sure you are aware that you can access mental health support at
the Counseling Center (counselingcenter.illinois.edu) or McKinley Health Center
(mckinley.illinois.edu). For mental health emergencies, you can call 911 or
walk-in to the Counseling Center, no appointment needed.
